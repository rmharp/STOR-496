# STOR 496 Final Project
#### An Analysis of Distress Tolerance as a Predictor of Early Treatment Dropout in a Residential Substance Abuse Treatment Facility

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis conducted for the STOR 496 course at UNC-Chapel Hill. The project focuses on examining distress tolerance as a predictor of early treatment dropout in a residential substance abuse treatment facility, extending upon the methodologies employed in the original study by Daughters et al. (2005).

## Data and Methods
- **Data Source**: The study includes data from the Salvation Army Harbor Light residential substance abuse treatment center. This will not be included in the repository due to the sensitive nature of the data.
- **Statistical Techniques**: Utilizes descriptive statistics, correlation tests, Welchâ€™s Two Sample t-tests, and Cox Proportional Hazards model for analysis.
- **Software and Packages**: Analysis conducted using R, with packages including `survival` for Cox Proportional Hazards models.

## Running the Analysis
1. Ensure you have R installed on your system.
2. Install the required R packages such as `install.packages("survival")`.
3. Run the scripts in the file to reproduce the analysis
##### *Note that this will require access to the original data or your own data set which most will not possess
